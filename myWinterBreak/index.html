    <p>Some of my best friends came home from college, and I went ice skating with them! I wasn't very good at it, but it was really nice to spend time together after months of not seeing each other.</p>
    <h3>Reasons I was bad at ice skating:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bad balance</li>
        <li>Inxperienced</li>
        <li>Skates didn't fit right</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I had a great Christmas with my family! We did all of our traditions: ate bagels on Christmas morning, watched The Grinch, and made cookies.</p>

    <p>It was really cold and rainy for pretty much all of break. I like rainy days, but the storms were really heavy and there was flooding near my house. </p>
